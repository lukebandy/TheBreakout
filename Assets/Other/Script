Someone has been falsley imprisoned for thievery. Track them down, and return them to your cell where you can escape through the secret tunnel. Unfortunetly, the only way of identifying them is with a recording of their scream, so listen carefully...

Excellent job. Until next time.

Well done for finding the prisoner, but you'd better run fast with those guards on your tail...

Well done, but these extra escapees are bound to draw attention...

You managed to get caught? Enjoy spending the next 10 years in prison...

The target has been thrown in isolation for trying to escape. I am not impressed.

Why would you escape on your own without the target?
